  Git-native issue tracking (beads), coding guidelines, knowledge injection, and spec-driven planning for AI agents. Drop-in replacement for bd/Beads with simpler architecture.
  Use for: tracking issues/beads with dependencies, creating bugs/features/tasks, planning specs, implementing features from specs, code reviews, committing code, creating PRs, loading coding guidelines (TypeScript, Python, TDD, golden testing, Convex, monorepo patterns), code cleanup, research briefs, architecture docs, agent handoffs, and checking out third-party library source code.
  Invoke when user mentions: tbd, beads, bd, shortcuts, issues, bugs, tasks, features, epics, todo, tracking, specs, planning, implementation, validation, guidelines, templates, commit, PR, pull request, code review, testing, TDD, test-driven, golden testing, snapshot testing, TypeScript, Python, Convex, monorepo, cleanup, dead code, refactor, handoff, research, architecture, labels, search, checkout library, source code review, or any workflow shortcut.

description: Full tbd workflow guide for agents
---
**`tbd` helps humans and agents ship code with greater speed, quality, and discipline.**

1. **Beads**: Git-native issue tracking (tasks, bugs, features).
   Never lose work across sessions.
   Drop-in replacement for `bd`.
2. **Spec-Driven Workflows**: Plan features → break into beads → implement
   systematically.
3. **Knowledge Injection**: 17+ engineering guidelines (TypeScript, Python, TDD,
   testing, Convex, monorepos) available on demand.
4. **Shortcuts**: Reusable instruction templates for common workflows (code review,
   commits, PRs, cleanup, handoffs).

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g get-tbd@latest
tbd setup --auto --prefix=<name>   # Fresh project (--prefix is REQUIRED: 2-8 alphabetic chars recommended. ALWAYS ASK THE USER FOR THE PREFIX; do not guess it)
tbd setup --auto                   # Existing tbd project (prefix already set)
tbd setup --from-beads             # Migration from .beads/ if `bd` has been used
```

## Routine Commands

```bash
tbd --help    # Command reference
tbd status    # Status
tbd doctor    # If there are problems

tbd setup --auto   # Run any time to refresh setup
tbd prime      # Restore full context on tbd after compaction
```

## CRITICAL: You Operate tbd — The User Doesn’t

**You are the tbd operator:** Users talk naturally; you translate their requests to tbd
actions. DO NOT tell users to run tbd commands.
That’s your job.

- **WRONG**: "Run `tbd create` to track this bug"

- **RIGHT**: *(you run `tbd create` yourself and tell the user it’s tracked)*

**Welcoming a user:** When users ask “what is tbd?”
or want help → run `tbd shortcut welcome-user`

## User Request → Agent Action

| User Says | You (the Agent) Run |
| --- | --- |

| "Check out this library's source" | `tbd shortcut checkout-third-party-repo` |
| *(your choice whenever appropriate)* | `tbd list`, `tbd dep add`, `tbd close`, `tbd sync`, etc. |

**Note:** Never gitignore `.tbd/workspaces/` — the outbox must be committed to your
working branch. See `tbd guidelines tbd-sync-troubleshooting` for details.

## CRITICAL: Session Closing Protocol

**Before saying “done”, you MUST complete this checklist:**

```
[ ] 1. git add + git commit
[ ] 2. git push
[ ] 3. gh pr checks <PR> --watch 2>&1 (IMPORTANT: WAIT for final summary, do NOT tell user it is done until you confirm it passes CI!)
[ ] 4. tbd close/update <id> for all beads worked on
[ ] 5. tbd sync
[ ] 6. CONFIRM CI passed (if failed: fix, run tests, re-push, restart from step 3)
```

**Work is not done until pushed, CI passes, and tbd is synced.**

## Bead Tracking Rules

- Track all task work not done immediately as beads (discovered work, TODOs,
  multi-session work)
- When in doubt, create a bead
- Check `tbd ready` when not given specific directions
- Always close/update beads and run `tbd sync` at session end
